## Elevate Your Branding with Sublimation Printing on Cardboard Using SubliSnap

Sublimation printing is a versatile and high-quality method for customizing various products. While it is commonly used on fabrics and ceramics, you can expand its application to cardboard using SubliSnap, a specialized coating that makes cardboard receptive to sublimation inks. This innovation opens new possibilities for small businesses, especially in branding and customizing shipping boxes. 

## Why Sublimate on Cardboard?

Customizing shipping boxes with sublimation printing offers numerous benefits:

* **Enhanced Branding**: Create visually appealing, custom-branded boxes that stand out.
* **Cost-Effective Marketing**: Turn every package into a mobile advertisement for your brand.
* **Professional Appearance**: Impress customers with high-quality, vibrant prints that enhance the unboxing experience.

## What is SubliSnap?

SubliSnap is a coating designed to make non-polyester surfaces, such as cardboard, suitable for sublimation printing. This coating allows sublimation inks to adhere effectively, ensuring durable and vibrant prints.

## How to Use SubliSnap for Cardboard Sublimation

### Materials Needed

* SubliSnap spray
* Cardboard boxes or sheets
* Sublimation printer
* Sublimation paper
* Heat-resistant tape
* Heat press or convection oven
* Protective gloves

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare the Cardboard**: Start with a clean, dry cardboard surface. Ensure there are no dust or oils that could interfere with the coating process.
2. **Apply SubliSnap**: Evenly spray a thin layer of SubliSnap onto the cardboard. Allow it to dry completely. This coating prepares the surface to accept sublimation inks.
3. **Print the Design**: Use a sublimation printer to print your design onto sublimation paper. Ensure the design is mirrored before printing.
4. **Align and Tape**: Place the printed sublimation paper onto the coated cardboard, aligning it precisely. Secure it with heat-resistant tape to prevent any shifting during the transfer process.
5. **Heat Press or Convection Oven**: 

   * **Heat Press**: Set the heat press to the recommended temperature (usually around 370°F) and time (about 40 seconds). Press the cardboard with firm pressure.
6. **Cool and Reveal**: Carefully remove the cardboard from the press or oven using protective gloves. Allow it to cool, then peel off the sublimation paper to reveal your vibrant, custom print.

## Tips for Best Results

* **Consistent Coating**: Ensure an even application of SubliSnap to avoid any blotchy or uneven areas.
* **Proper Alignment**: Take your time to align the sublimation paper correctly to prevent any misprints.
* **Monitor Temperature and Time**: Follow the recommended settings for your equipment to avoid over or under-heating.

## Conclusion

Using SubliSnap to sublimate on cardboard is a game-changer for small businesses looking to enhance their branding. Custom shipping boxes not only improve the customer experience but also serve as a powerful marketing tool. Start experimenting with SubliSnap and sublimation printing to create unique, branded packaging that sets your business apart.

By leveraging this innovative coating, you can expand the possibilities of sublimation printing and take your branding efforts to new heights.
