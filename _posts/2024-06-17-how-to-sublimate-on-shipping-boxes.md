## Elevate Your Branding with Sublimation Printing on Cardboard Using SubliSnap

Sublimation printing is a versatile and high-quality method for customizing various products. While it is commonly used on fabrics and ceramics, you can expand its application to cardboard using SubliSnap, a specialized coating that makes cardboard receptive to sublimation inks. This innovation opens new possibilities for small businesses, especially in branding and customizing shipping boxes. 

## Why Sublimate on Cardboard?

Customizing shipping boxes with sublimation printing offers numerous benefits:

* **Enhanced Branding**: Create visually appealing, custom-branded boxes that stand out.
* **Cost-Effective Marketing**: Turn every package into a mobile advertisement for your brand at a very low cost. 
* **Professional Appearance**: Impress customers with high-quality, vibrant prints that enhance the unboxing experience.

## What is SubliSnap?

SubliSnap is a coating designed to make non-polyester surfaces, such as cardboard, suitable for sublimation printing. This coating allows sublimation inks to adhere effectively, ensuring durable and vibrant prints.

## How to Use SubliSnap for Cardboard Sublimation

### Materials Needed

* SubliSnap cardboard solution
* Cardboard boxes or sheets
* Sublimation printer
* Sublimation paper
* Heat-resistant tape
* Heat press 
* Protective gloves

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare the Cardboard**: Start with a clean, dry cardboard surface. Ensure there are no dust or oils that could interfere with the coating process.
2. **Apply SubliSnap**: Evenly spread the solution onto the cardboard. The first box tends to get the most solution and you may need to wipe the excess off.
3. **Print the Design**: Use a sublimation printer to print your design onto sublimation paper. Ensure the design is mirrored before printing.
4. **Align and Tape**: Place the printed sublimation paper onto the coated cardboard, aligning it precisely. Secure it with heat-resistant tape to prevent any shifting during the transfer process.
5. **Heat Press or Convection Oven**: 

   * **Heat Press**: Set the heat press to the recommended temperature (usually around 370°F) and time (about 40 seconds). Press the cardboard with firm pressure.
6. **Cool and Reveal**: Carefully remove the cardboard from the press or oven using protective gloves. Allow it to cool, then peel off the sublimation paper to reveal your vibrant, custom print.

## Tips for Best Results

* **Consistent Coating**: Ensure an even application of SubliSnap to avoid any blotchy or uneven areas.
* **Proper Alignment**: Take your time to align the sublimation paper correctly to prevent any misprints.
* **Monitor Temperature and Time**: Follow the recommended settings for your equipment to avoid over or under-heating.

## T﻿he Money you Save

W﻿hat saves you the most money here is the ability to create branding at low quantities. To even get close to these savings you would need to purchase several thousand boxes to qualify for lower prices. If you are a small business this barrier to entry can be difficult, not just for the money spent but even having the room to store all these boxes. 

* Sublimation paper 7 cents a sheet. 
* Sublimation Ink 3 cents per letter page printed. 
* B﻿lank box 9x6x4 white media mailer .65 cents each

  T﻿he total for self printing comes out to .75 per box with a minimum order of 25 boxes. In contrast it cost $4.52 per box with a minimum order of 25 boxes for printed boxes. At 100 boxes this does drop down to $2.64 but you are still looking at more than 3 times the price and this is not inclusive of shipping. Sadly the amount you save still only drops to about $1.05 even when ordering 50K printed boxes. When your company needs 50k boxes, $1.05 per box would then be absolutely worth it considering the time needed to make the boxes.  This solution allows you to invest your money where it makes sense. The idea here is not to keep using this product. The goal is to get you off the ground running with a strong brand and eventually get to a point to where when you need large quantities of boxes you have the space and funds to do so. 

## Conclusion

The barrier to entry for branding your products can be steep when you are first starting out. Using SubliSnap to sublimate on cardboard is a game-changer for small businesses looking to enhance their branding. Custom shipping boxes not only improve the customer experience but also serve as a powerful marketing tool. Start experimenting with SubliSnap and sublimation printing to create unique, branded packaging that sets your business apart.

By leveraging this innovative coating, you can expand the possibilities of sublimation printing and take your branding efforts to new heights.
