# Sublimation for Beginners: Your Ultimate Guide

## Introduction

Learn all about dye sublimation for beginners, including what it is, what you need, and what you can make! Sublimation is a fun and useful crafting technique that creates vibrant, full-color objects like shirts, mugs, tumblers, signs, and more. If you’re familiar with Cricut Infusible Ink, then you already know a bit about sublimation, as Infusible Ink is a type of sublimation! This guide will show you how to print your own custom sublimation transfers, allowing you to create beautiful items for home décor or even start a small business selling custom sublimation items.

## What is Sublimation?

Sublimation uses a special ink from dye-sublimation printers that can then be transferred to another object with a compatible coating. You first print a design with a sublimation printer — which uses special sublimation ink on special transfer paper — then use high temperatures and pressure to transfer the ink permanently to something else that has a coating that can absorb the ink, such as polyester T-shirts or coated ceramic mugs.

After the sublimation cools, which happens quite quickly, the design becomes embedded right in the surface of the object and won’t crack, peel, rub off, or wash away. Here’s a polyester-coated rubber mousepad and a coated ceramic mug with sublimation designs!

## Benefits of Sublimation

Sublimation will last as long as whatever surface you’re putting it onto, which is amazing. And you can’t feel it — it’s like it just becomes a part of the fabric or object, which it basically does. The dye sublimation process can create beautiful full-color designs with continuous tones that are really vibrant!

## What Can You Sublimate Onto?

You can transfer dye-sublimation printing onto a lot of things! You can sublimate gorgeous, full-color designs onto anything made of polyester or anything with a polyester coating. This includes polyester T-shirts, tote bags, aprons, garden flags, pillowcases, and more. You can get sublimation blanks for countless items… ceramic mugs, stainless steel tumblers, mouse pads, puzzles, coasters, oven mitts, and more! It’s also possible to do things like wood and MDF when you use a special layer. If there’s something you want to sublimate, you can likely find a way to do it! Everything you see in the photo below is something I sublimated! Aren’t they cool?

## A Few of the Things I've Sublimated

* White Polyester T-Shirts and Colored Polyester/Cotton Shirts — look for polyester count of at least 65% or higher (unless you have [SubliSnap Sublimation Spray](https://www.sublisnap.com) which works with with all cotton and cotton blends)
* Satin ribbons – Print dimensions: .8 inch wide
* Sublimation coasters, white polyester and rubber – Print dimensions: 4″ circle
* Mason jar tumblers, 17 oz. white stainless steel – Print dimensions: 3.4″ tall by 17.8″ wide
* Glitter sublimation tumblers, 20 oz. insulated stainless steel skinny – Print dimensions: 8.07″ tall by 8.89″ wide
* Mousepads – Print dimensions: 7.9″ tall by 9.6″ wide
* Keychains, squares, hearts, circles, rectangles
* Kitchen towels – Print dimensions: 15″ tall by 26″ wide
* Flour sack towels – Print dimensions: 28″ tall by 28″ wide
* License plate blanks – Print dimensions 6″ tall by 12″ wide
* Sequin pillow covers – Print dimensions 18″ tall by 18″ wide
* Polyester door mats – Print dimensions 29.5″ tall by 17″ wide
* Throw Blankets – Print dimensions 7.9″ tall by 9.8″ wide (for each blank spot on the 40″ x 60″ blanket)
* Jigsaw Puzzles – Print dimensions 7.5″ tall by 9.8 inches wide
* Glitter iron-on vinyl (to transfer onto something cotton or something dark)

## Is Sublimation Ink Transparent?

Yes, sublimation ink is transparent, which means the base color of your object matters. An object with white or light colors will show transparent ink much better than a dark object. Here’s what sublimation ink looks like on a black shirt — you cannot even see it!

If you must use a cotton or dark shirt, you can sublimate onto something else — like white glitter iron-on vinyl or white flocked vinyl — then apply that vinyl to your shirt.

## Sublimation vs. Iron-On Vinyl

Iron-on vinyl, also known as heat transfer vinyl, is a thin sheet of PVC with a heat-activated adhesive on one side. You can put iron-on vinyl on nearly anything of any color, unlike sublimation. However, vinyl doesn’t go into the surface like sublimation — it just lies on top. Vinyl can crack and peel over time, whereas sublimation does not. You also have to weed iron-on vinyl, which you don’t have to do with sublimation. Plus, you can’t do full-color designs with HTV without a lot of layering.

## Sublimation vs. Screen Printing

Screen printing uses ink to put a design on a surface, which lies on top of the surface rather than going into the surface like sublimation. Sublimation allows for intricate designs that are harder to achieve with home screen printing.

## What You Need to Get Started in Sublimation

### Sublimation Printers

I have four sublimation printers that I’ve set up and tested: Sawgrass and Epson printers are popular choices. Some are purpose-built for sublimation, while others are converted inkjet printers.

### Sublimation Ink

You need special sublimation ink. Printers like the Sawgrass and Epson SureColor come with their own sublimation ink. For converted inkjet printers, you'll need to buy sublimation ink separately.

### Sublimation Paper

Special paper like A-Sub or TruePix sublimation paper is best for vibrant prints. Laser copy paper can also be used but may result in faded prints.

### Heat Presses

You can use various heat sources such as an EasyPress, traditional heat press, or Cricut Autopress. For unusual shapes, consider using a hat press, mug press, or tumbler press.

### Sublimation Blanks

Blanks are surfaces with a polyester coating or high polyester content. Common items include T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, tumblers, and more.

### Design Software

Use software like Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape, Gimp, Canva, or Silhouette Studio to create your designs. Many free designs are available online.

### ICC Printer Profiles

Add ICC printer profiles for true color accuracy. These profiles are specific to the ink and printer and are available for free.

## How Hard is it to Get Started in Sublimation?

Starting with sublimation involves a learning curve, but with the right tools and practice, you can create professional and durable products. Remember the basics: use a sublimation printer with sublimation ink, a high-heat source, and a sublimation-ready surface.
