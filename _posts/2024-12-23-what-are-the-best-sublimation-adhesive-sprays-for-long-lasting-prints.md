## The Best Sublimation Sprays for Long-Lasting Prints

When it comes to sublimation printing, adhesive sprays play a critical role in ensuring flawless results. These sprays temporarily bond transfer paper to your substrate, preventing it from shifting during the heat press process. Without a proper adhesive spray, even the most skilled printer can experience ghosting or alignment issues, which ruin the final product. So, which adhesive spray should you trust for your next project? Let’s take a look at some top contenders and explore why **[SubliSnap](https://sublisnap.com)** is the ultimate solution.

### Why Sublimation Adhesive Sprays Matter

Sublimation is a precise process that involves transferring ink onto substrates like polyester, ceramic, or specially coated materials. A slight shift in the transfer paper during pressing can lead to blurred or misaligned designs. Adhesive sprays eliminate this risk by securing the transfer paper in place, making them indispensable for high-quality prints.

Not all sprays are created equal, however. The strength, consistency, and ease of use of an adhesive spray can significantly affect your printing experience. That’s why it’s essential to choose a product that delivers reliable performance without damaging your substrates.
