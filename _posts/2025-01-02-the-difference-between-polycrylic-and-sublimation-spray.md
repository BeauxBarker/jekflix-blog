## Why Polyacrylic Wood Finish Might Not Be the Best Solution for Sublimation on Cotton Shirts

When it comes to sublimating on cotton shirts, professional results require the right materials and techniques. Many hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts often look for "cheap hacks" to achieve a sublimated design on white cotton shirts. One such method that has been circulating is using **polyacrylic (polycrylic) wood finish** as a substitute for a proper sublimation coating. However, while this may work for basic, short-term projects, it's important to understand why polyacrylic isn't the best choice for professionals or anyone looking for lasting, high-quality results.

## Polyacrylic Wood Finish and Its Limitations

Polyacrylic wood finish is typically made from **polyacrylic resin**. This resin is primarily used for wood surfaces, offering a protective, glossy coating. When it comes to sublimation, however, the issue lies in the nature of the chemical makeup of polyacrylic finishes. 

Sublimation printing involves turning solid ink into gas without passing through a liquid phase. For this to happen properly, the material you're printing on needs to have a coating that can accept the sublimation dyes. Polyacrylic finishes, though durable on wood, do not provide the ideal surface for sublimation to occur efficiently on fabric, especially cotton. In addition, the inconsistent adhesion between the polyacrylic coating and cotton fibers can lead to uneven transfers, poor color reproduction, and premature fading over time.

## Is Polyacrylic a Good Option for Hobbyists?

For hobbyists or those creating low-cost, short-term projects, using a polyacrylic finish might seem like a convenient, budget-friendly alternative. It may work in a pinch, especially if you're just experimenting with sublimation on cotton. However, it’s crucial to understand that polyacrylic is not a professional solution, and while it may provide some success for low-stakes projects, the results will likely not meet your expectations in terms of longevity and quality.

Using a wood finish for sublimation on cotton may yield a design that looks acceptable at first but will likely degrade quickly. The transfer could fade after a few washes, and the texture may not feel as smooth or professional as that achieved with a dedicated sublimation product. Therefore, polyacrylic is better suited for non-critical, fun projects where you're less concerned about quality and more focused on getting a basic result.

## Why Choose Sublisnap over Polyacrylic?

For those serious about achieving **high-quality sublimation prints** on cotton shirts, there’s a much better option available: **Sublisnap Sublimation Spray**.

Sublisnap is specifically designed for use with sublimation. Unlike polyacrylic, it’s made with **acrylic acid** — a crucial difference in its formulation. Acrylic acid is super absorbent. Why does this matter? You do not want your solution to be 'fast drying' to avoid 'coating' your shirt. This is what happens with resin based formulas. What you want is for the liquid to penetrate and bond with the cotton. Acrylic acid ensures the proper chemical bonding with fabric fibers, allowing the sublimation ink to adhere more effectively. This results in a cleaner, brighter, and longer-lasting transfer on cotton shirts. If you are interesting in sublimating on wood, the polyacrylic would actually be an awesome choice as wood is extremely thick and you would more likely just want the very surface of the wood to be penetrated. So unless you are going around wearing wooden shirts, I think it is safe to say stick with Sublisnap or any sublimation spray that uses acrylic acid of polyacrlic formulas. 

Here’s why professionals and those looking for quality sublimation results should choose Sublisnap:

1. **Tailored for Fabric:** Sublisnap is formulated specifically for cotton and other fabrics, making it the ideal choice for apparel sublimation.
2. **Long-Lasting Results:** Unlike polyacrylic, which may degrade over time, Sublisnap is designed to provide durable prints that stand up to multiple washes. Your designs will remain vibrant for longer, giving you a more professional and lasting result.
3. **Better Adhesion:** The acrylic acid in Sublisnap provides superior adhesion between the sublimation inks and the fabric, ensuring vibrant colors and high-definition prints.
4. **Simplicity and Efficiency:** Sublisnap is easy to apply with a spray, providing a smooth and consistent coating without the mess or hassle of other materials like polyacrylic. It’s a perfect solution for anyone looking to achieve professional-grade sublimation results with minimal effort.

## Conclusion

While polyacrylic wood finish may serve as a temporary fix for hobbyists looking to create sublimation projects on cotton shirts, it’s far from the best solution for achieving high-quality, durable prints. For professionals, or anyone who values long-lasting, vibrant designs, **Sublisnap Sublimation Spray** is the superior option. Designed specifically for sublimation on cotton, it ensures better adhesion, enhanced durability, and vibrant results that will last.
